Symptoms:

Look for olive-green to brown spots on leaves, fruit, and twigs.

The spots on leaves often have a velvety texture at first, later turning darker and more defined.

Infected leaves can become twisted, distorted, and may fall off the tree early.

On the fruit, the spots become dark, scabby, and cork-like, and can cause the fruit to crack, making it unfit for sale.

Treatment Guide:

Chemical Treatment: Spraying fungicides is the primary method of control during the growing season. Sprays should start from the green tip stage of the buds and continue at 10-15 day intervals, especially during rainy or humid weather. Common fungicides used in India include Mancozeb, Myclobutanil, or Captan.

CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE: Always consult a local agricultural extension officer for the correct fungicide, dosage, and spray schedule. Read and follow all safety instructions on the product label carefully.

Organic Management: Sprays of wettable sulfur or a Bordeaux mixture can be effective organic options if applied preventatively and consistently.

Prevention Plan:

Orchard Sanitation: This is the most critical step. The scab fungus overwinters on fallen leaves. In autumn, rake and destroy (burn or compost far from the orchard) all fallen leaves to drastically reduce the source of infection for the next year.

Resistant Varieties: When planting new trees, choose apple varieties that are known to be resistant or tolerant to apple scab.

Pruning: Prune trees annually during the dormant season to open up the canopy. This increases air circulation and allows leaves to dry faster, making it harder for the fungus to infect them.

Watering: Use drip or basin irrigation instead of overhead sprinklers to keep the leaves as dry as possible.
