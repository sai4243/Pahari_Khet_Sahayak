Symptoms:

The most obvious sign is the appearance of white, powdery spots on the leaves, stems, and petioles.

These spots look like they have been dusted with flour. They can appear on both the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves.

The infection usually starts on older, lower leaves that are shaded.

As the disease progresses, the spots enlarge and can cover the entire leaf, causing it to turn yellow, then brown and dry, and eventually die. This reduces the plant's ability to produce fruit, leading to lower yields and poor-quality squash.

Treatment Guide:

Chemical Treatment: If the disease is severe, fungicides can be effective. Products containing Myclobutanil, Wettable Sulfur, or Thiophanate-methyl are commonly used. It's important to get good spray coverage on both sides of the leaves.

CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE: Always consult a local agricultural extension officer for advice. Follow all safety instructions on the product label. Do not apply sulfur sprays in hot weather (above 32°C) as it can burn the leaves.

Organic and Cultural Management:

Milk Spray: A spray of diluted milk (1 part milk to 9 parts water) applied in bright sunlight can be surprisingly effective.

Neem Oil: A solution of neem oil acts as a good fungicide.

Baking Soda Spray: A solution of potassium bicarbonate (baking soda) with a small amount of soap can also control the fungus.

Prevention Plan:

Resistant Varieties: Plant squash and pumpkin varieties that are specifically advertised as being resistant to powdery mildew. This is the easiest and most effective preventative measure.

Full Sun and Good Airflow: Plant squash in a location that gets full sun all day. Provide plenty of space between plants to promote good air circulation, which helps keep the leaves dry and less hospitable to the fungus.

Watering Technique: Water the plants at the base, directly on the soil, using drip irrigation or a soaker hose. Avoid overhead watering that wets the leaves.

Early Detection and Removal: At the first sign of powdery mildew, prune out and destroy the infected leaves to slow the spread of the disease.
