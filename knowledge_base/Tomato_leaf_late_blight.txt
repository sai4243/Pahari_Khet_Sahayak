Symptoms:

This is the same aggressive disease that affects potatoes and can destroy a crop very quickly.

It appears as large, water-soaked, greenish-black or brown lesions on leaves and stems.

In humid or moist conditions, a fuzzy, white mold will appear on the underside of the leaves at the edge of the lesion.

The disease spreads extremely fast, and the entire plant can wither and die in a matter of days.

On green tomato fruit, it causes large, firm, greasy, brown-to-black blotches.

Treatment Guide:

Chemical Treatment: Immediate and preventative action is required. Once you see it, it may be too late. A strict fungicide spray schedule is necessary, especially when cool, wet weather is forecast. Products containing Mancozeb, Chlorothalonil, or systemic fungicides like Metalaxyl are used.

CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE: This is an emergency disease. Consult a local expert immediately for a management plan. Follow all safety protocols.

Prevention Plan:

Use Disease-Free Transplants: Start with healthy plants from a reputable source.

Destroy Volunteers: Remove and destroy any "volunteer" potato or tomato plants that grow in or near your field, as they are a primary source of early infection.

Ensure Good Airflow: Stake, prune, and provide wide spacing for your plants to keep them as dry as possible.

Water at the Soil Level: Use drip irrigation to avoid wetting the leaves.

Preventative Spraying: In regions where late blight is common, a preventative fungicide program is the most reliable way to protect the crop. Start spraying before you see any symptoms.
