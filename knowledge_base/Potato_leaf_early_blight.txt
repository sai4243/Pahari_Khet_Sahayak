Symptoms:

Look for small, dark brown to black spots on the lower, older leaves of the plant.

A key feature of these spots is the presence of concentric rings, creating a "target board" or "bull's-eye" appearance. A yellow halo often surrounds the spots.

As the disease progresses, the spots enlarge, and the infected leaves turn yellow, wither, and die, but often remain attached to the plant.

Lesions can also appear on the stems and, less commonly, on the potato tubers, where they are dark, sunken, and have a purplish border.

Treatment Guide:

Chemical Treatment: If the infection is detected early and weather conditions are favorable (warm and humid), fungicidal sprays can protect healthy foliage. Fungicides containing Mancozeb, Chlorothalonil, or Copper Oxychloride are effective. It is crucial to alternate between different types of fungicides to prevent the fungus from developing resistance.

CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE: Always consult a local agricultural extension officer for the correct fungicide, dosage, and spray schedule for your specific area. Read and follow all safety instructions on the product label.

Organic and Cultural Management: At the first sign, remove and destroy infected lower leaves to slow the spread. Sprays of copper-based organic fungicides or a Bordeaux mixture can be effective if applied as a preventative measure before the disease becomes severe.

Prevention Plan:

Use Certified Seed: This is the most important step. Start with certified, disease-free seed potatoes. Do not use tubers from a previously infected crop.

Crop Rotation: Do not plant potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants (brinjal), or peppers in the same field for at least 2-3 years. The fungus can survive in the soil and on infected plant debris.

Field Sanitation: After harvest, remove and completely destroy all old vines, leaves, and any leftover tubers from the field. Plowing them deep into the soil can also help.

Proper Nutrition: Maintain a balanced soil fertility program. Adequate potassium levels can help reduce the severity of early blight. Avoid over-fertilizing with nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible.

Water Management: Water the plants at the base using drip or furrow irrigation. Avoid overhead sprinklers, which wet the leaves and create ideal conditions for fungal spores to germinate. If you must water overhead, do so in the morning so the leaves can dry quickly.

Good Air Circulation: Ensure proper spacing between plants to promote airflow and reduce humidity within the plant canopy.
