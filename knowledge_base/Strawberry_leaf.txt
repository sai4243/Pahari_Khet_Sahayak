Appearance of a Healthy Leaf:

A healthy strawberry leaf is trifoliate (has three leaflets) and is a vibrant, glossy green.

The edges of the leaflets are toothed.

The leaves should be free of purplish spots, scorch marks, yellowing, or any powdery residue. The plant should be producing new leaves from the central crown.

Key Practices for Maintaining Health:

Planting on Raised Beds: Especially in hilly areas with heavy monsoon rains, planting strawberries on raised beds is critical. This ensures excellent soil drainage and prevents waterlogging, which can lead to root rot.

Mulching: Apply a thick layer of clean straw or pine needle mulch around the plants. This has many benefits: it keeps the fruit off the soil (preventing rot), suppresses weeds, conserves soil moisture, and keeps the soil cool.

Watering: Strawberries have shallow roots, so they need consistent moisture. Water them regularly at the base of the plant.

Renovation: For June-bearing varieties, renovate the patch right after the harvest is over. This involves mowing the old leaves off, narrowing the rows, and applying fertilizer to encourage new, vigorous growth for the next year's crop.

Fertility: Strawberries are not heavy feeders. A balanced fertilizer applied at the time of renovation and again in the late summer is usually sufficient. Too much nitrogen will result in excessive leaves and fewer, poorer-quality fruits.
