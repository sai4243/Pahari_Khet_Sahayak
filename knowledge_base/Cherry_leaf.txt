Appearance of a Healthy Leaf:

Healthy cherry leaves are typically dark green, oval-shaped with a pointed tip, and have toothed (serrated) edges.

The leaf surface should be smooth and free from any spots, holes, or powdery mildew.

Key Practices for Maintaining Health:

Canopy Management & Pruning: Prune trees annually during the dormant winter season. The goal is to create an open canopy by removing crossing branches and dense growth. This improves sunlight penetration and air circulation, which is the single best defense against fungal diseases like powdery mildew, especially during the monsoon season.

Water Management: Water deeply at the base of the tree, allowing the soil to partially dry out between waterings. Use basin or drip irrigation to avoid wetting the leaves. Ensure the planting site, especially on terraces, has excellent drainage to prevent root rot.

Soil Health & Fertilization: Apply well-rotted compost or a balanced fertilizer in the spring as new growth begins. Healthy soil with plenty of organic matter helps retain moisture and provides a steady supply of nutrients. Conduct a soil test every few years to check for deficiencies.

Orchard Sanitation: After leaves fall in autumn, rake them up and either burn them or compost them far away from the orchard. This practice removes the overwintering sites for many common cherry diseases and pests.

Regular Monitoring: Walk through your orchard weekly. Check leaves (top and bottom) and young shoots for early signs of pests like aphids or diseases. Early detection is key to easy management.
