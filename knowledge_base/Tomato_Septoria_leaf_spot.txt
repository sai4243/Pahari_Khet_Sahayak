Symptoms:

Starts with numerous small, water-soaked spots on the lower leaves.

The spots are circular and grow to about 1/8 inch in diameter. The center of the spots turns a tan or grey color, with a distinct dark brown border.

The most identifiable feature is the presence of tiny black dots (pycnidia), which are the fruiting bodies of the fungus, in the center of these spots.

Heavily infected leaves turn yellow, wither, and drop off, progressively moving up the plant. This defoliation exposes the fruit to sunscald.

Treatment Guide:

Chemical Treatment: Fungicides can protect new, uninfected growth. Products containing Mancozeb or Chlorothalonil are effective. Begin spraying when the first spots are seen and continue every 7-10 days during periods of warm, wet weather.

CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE: Consult a local agricultural expert for guidance. Always follow the product label's safety and application instructions.

Organic Management: Copper-based organic fungicides can provide good control if applied before the disease becomes widespread.

Prevention Plan:

Crop Rotation: A rotation of at least two years away from tomatoes and other related crops (potato, eggplant) is recommended.

Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant debris at the end of the season. The fungus can survive for several years on old plant material.

Improve Air Circulation: Stake plants and prune lower leaves. Wider spacing between plants helps reduce the humidity that the disease loves.

Watering: Water at the base of the plant to keep the foliage as dry as possible.

Weed Control: Some weeds can act as hosts for the Septoria fungus. Keep the area in and around your tomato patch clean.
