Symptoms (Damage from a Pest, not a Disease):



The first sign of damage is fine, yellow or white stippling (tiny dots) on the upper surface of the leaves.

As the infestation grows, the leaves may take on a bronze or dusty appearance.

A key sign is the presence of very fine, silky webbing on the undersides of the leaves, between leaves, or between the stem and leaves. You may need to look closely to see it.

In a heavy infestation, the leaves will turn yellow or brown, become dry and brittle, and eventually fall off. The plant's growth will be severely stunted.

Treatment Guide:



Chemical Treatment (Miticides): Spider mites are not insects, so regular insecticides may not work. You need to use a specific product called a miticide. Products containing Spiromesifen, Abamectin, or Propargite are effective. It's crucial to get good spray coverage on the undersides of the leaves where the mites live.

CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE: Mites can develop resistance quickly, so it's important to rotate different types of miticides. Follow all label instructions.

Organic and Cultural Management:

Water Spray: A strong jet of water can be used to physically knock the mites off the plants. Do this in the morning and repeat every few days.

Horticultural Oil or Neem Oil: These oils work by suffocating the mites. They must be applied thoroughly to the undersides of the leaves.

Predatory Mites: For larger areas, releasing beneficial predatory mites can be an effective biological control.

Prevention Plan:



Keep Plants Well-Watered: Spider mites thrive in hot, dry, and dusty conditions. Plants that are water-stressed are much more susceptible. Ensure your plants are watered regularly and properly.

Manage Dust: In dusty areas, occasionally hosing down the plants and surrounding paths can help create a less favorable environment for mites.

Early Detection: Regularly inspect the undersides of the lower leaves for any signs of stippling or webbing. Catching an infestation early makes it much easier to control.

Weed Control: Many weeds, such as bindweed, are hosts for spider mites. Keep the area around your crops free of these weeds.
