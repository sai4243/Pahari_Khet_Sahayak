Appearance of a Healthy Leaf:

Healthy bell pepper (Shimla Mirch) leaves are typically a deep, uniform green.

The leaves are smooth, glossy, and have a symmetrical shape without any spots, yellowing, or holes.

The plant itself should look vigorous and be actively producing new growth.

Key Practices for Maintaining Health:

Consistent Watering: Pepper plants need consistent moisture. Water them deeply at the base to keep the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged. Irregular watering can lead to problems like blossom-end rot on the fruit.

Balanced Nutrition: Feed the plants with a balanced fertilizer that is not excessively high in nitrogen. Ensure the plants have enough calcium, which is crucial for preventing blossom-end rot.

Staking and Support: As the plants grow and bear fruit, provide stakes or cages to support them. This keeps the leaves and fruit off the ground, improving air circulation and reducing the risk of soil-borne diseases.

Weed Control: Keep the area around your plants free of weeds, as they compete for nutrients and water, and can harbor pests and diseases.

Monitor for Pests: Regularly check the undersides of leaves for common pests like aphids or mites.
