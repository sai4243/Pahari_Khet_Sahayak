Symptoms:

Symptoms usually appear on older, lower leaves first.

Look for pale greenish or yellowish spots on the upper surface of the leaves. These spots have indefinite borders.

The most characteristic sign is on the underside of the leaves, where a patch of velvety, olive-green to brownish mold will grow directly beneath the yellow spots on top.

As the disease progresses, infected leaves will curl, wither, and drop off.

Treatment Guide:

Chemical Treatment: Fungicides can be used, but good coverage on the underside of the leaves is essential. Products containing Mancozeb, Chlorothalonil, or copper-based fungicides are effective.

CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE: Always follow the safety and application instructions on the product label.

Organic Management: Copper-based sprays or bio-fungicides containing Bacillus subtilis can be effective if applied preventatively.

Prevention Plan:

Improve Air Circulation: This is the most important control measure. The disease thrives in high humidity. Ensure wide spacing between plants, stake them properly, and prune lower leaves to create an open canopy where air can move freely.

Ventilation: If growing in a polyhouse or greenhouse, ensure it is well-ventilated day and night to reduce humidity.

Water Management: Water in the morning at the soil level to ensure leaves are dry for most of the day.

Resistant Varieties: Choose tomato varieties that have resistance to leaf mold.

Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant debris at the end of the season.
