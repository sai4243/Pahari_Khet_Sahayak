1. Powdery Mildew
SYMPTOMS:

Leaf Lesions: Begins as small, fluffy, white-to-greyish powdery patches, primarily on the upper surface of lower leaves.

Progression: These patches expand and merge, potentially covering the entire leaf, stem, and even the earhead, giving the plant a frosted or whitewashed appearance.

Leaf Damage: Infected leaves may turn yellow (chlorotic), then brown, and die prematurely.

Advanced Stage: Tiny black specks, which are the fungal fruiting bodies (cleistothecia), may become visible within the white patches late in the season.

Overall Impact: Severe infections lead to stunted growth, reduced photosynthesis, and poorly filled, shriveled grains.

TREATMENT:

Chemical Control:

Apply foliar fungicides like Propiconazole (e.g., Tilt 25 EC @ 0.1%) or Tebuconazole. A spray of wettable sulfur (0.2%) is also effective, especially in the early stages.

Application should begin at the first sign of disease, particularly on the flag leaf, to protect yield. Follow local agricultural extension advice for timing and dosage.

Biological & Organic Control:

Foliar sprays of a neem oil solution or potassium bicarbonate can suppress fungal growth if applied early and regularly.

Bio-fungicides containing Trichoderma viride or Pseudomonas fluorescens have shown suppressive effects.

Cultural Control:

Pruning and destroying heavily infected lower leaves can reduce the inoculum load and improve air circulation within the plant canopy.

PREVENTION:

Resistant Varieties: Planting genetically resistant or tolerant wheat varieties is the most effective and economical control method. Consult local agricultural bodies for recommended varieties in your region (e.g., for Uttarakhand, check with GB Pant University).

Proper Spacing & Canopy Management: Ensure optimal seed rate and spacing to promote good air circulation, which reduces humidity and discourages fungal growth.

Balanced Nutrition: Avoid excessive application of nitrogen fertilizers, as it promotes lush, succulent growth that is highly susceptible to mildew. Ensure adequate levels of potassium and silicon, which strengthen plant cell walls.

Field Sanitation: After harvest, remove and destroy infected plant debris. Deep plowing can help bury the fungal inoculum, reducing its survival to the next season.
