Symptoms:

Small, water-soaked, irregular spots appear on the underside of the leaves.

These spots enlarge and become purplish-grey with a black center and sometimes a yellow halo.

The centers of the spots may dry out and fall away, giving the leaf a "shot-hole" appearance.

Spots can also appear on the stems and fruit. On fruit, they are raised and scabby.

Infected leaves often turn yellow and drop, reducing the plant's strength and exposing the fruit to sunscald.

Treatment Guide:

Chemical Treatment: Once the disease is present, it is difficult to control with chemicals. Preventative sprays are key. Copper-based bactericides (like Copper Hydroxide or Copper Oxychloride) are most effective.

CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE: Always consult a local agricultural expert. Follow all safety and application instructions on the product label. Do not apply copper sprays in very hot, sunny weather.

Organic Management: Copper-based sprays are often permitted in organic farming.

Prevention Plan:

Use Clean Seeds: Start with high-quality, certified disease-free seeds or treat your own seeds by soaking them in hot water (50°C) for 25 minutes.

Crop Rotation: Do not plant peppers, tomatoes, or eggplants in the same spot for at least 2-3 years, as the bacteria can survive in the soil and on plant debris.

Field Sanitation: Remove and destroy all plant debris after harvesting. Keep weeds under control.

Water Management: Use drip irrigation to avoid wetting the leaves. If you must use overhead watering, do it in the morning so the leaves can dry quickly.

Improve Air Circulation: Provide adequate spacing between plants.
