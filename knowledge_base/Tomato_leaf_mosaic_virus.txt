Symptoms:

THERE IS NO CURE FOR THIS VIRUS.

The most common symptom is a light green and dark green mottled or mosaic pattern on the leaves.

Leaves may be curled, distorted, or smaller than normal.

The overall growth of the plant is often stunted, and it will produce fewer, lower-quality fruits.

Symptoms can vary depending on the plant variety and environmental conditions.

Treatment Guide:

No Treatment Exists: There are no chemical or organic sprays that can cure a plant once it is infected with a virus.

Immediate Removal: As soon as a plant is positively identified with a virus, it must be carefully uprooted and destroyed (burned or buried far from the garden) to prevent it from acting as a source of infection for other plants.

Prevention Plan:

Resistant Varieties: The most effective method is to plant tomato varieties that are advertised as being resistant to Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) or Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV).

Use Clean Seed: The virus can be seed-borne. Purchase seeds from reputable sources.

Control Weeds: Many weeds can be hosts for the virus. Keep the area in and around your tomato patch clean.

Control Insects: Aphids are a major vector (spreader) of mosaic viruses. Managing aphid populations can help reduce the spread.

Practice Good Hygiene: The virus is easily spread mechanically. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before handling plants. Disinfect tools (like pruners) with a bleach solution or rubbing alcohol, especially after working with an infected plant.
