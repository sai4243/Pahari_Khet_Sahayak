Appearance of a Healthy Leaf:

A healthy apple leaf has a uniform, vibrant green color.

The surface is smooth, without any spots, discoloration, or powdery residue.

The leaf shape is normal for the variety, without any curling, twisting, or distortion.

Key Practices for Maintaining Health:

Proper Nutrition: Provide a balanced supply of nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) based on a soil test. Avoid applying too much nitrogen, as it can lead to excessive, weak growth that is more prone to diseases.

Annual Pruning: Prune your apple trees every winter. This removes dead or diseased wood, improves the tree's structure, and allows for better sunlight penetration and air circulation throughout the canopy, which naturally reduces the risk of fungal diseases.

Water Management: Water the trees deeply but infrequently at the base. Avoid wetting the leaves with overhead sprinklers, as this encourages fungal growth. Ensure the soil has good drainage, especially on hillside terraces.

Regular Monitoring: Walk through your orchard regularly to inspect the leaves and fruit. Catching any problem like scab, rust, or pests early makes it much easier to manage.
