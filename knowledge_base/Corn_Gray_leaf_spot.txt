Symptoms:

Characterized by long, narrow, rectangular lesions on the corn leaves.

The lesions are pale brown or grey and are distinctly limited by the leaf veins, giving them straight, sharp edges.

The disease starts on the lower leaves and progresses up the plant as the season continues.

In humid and overcast conditions, these lesions can merge and cause large portions of the leaf to die, which reduces the plant's ability to fill the grains, leading to lower yield and poor quality.

Treatment Guide:

Chemical Treatment: If the disease is severe and detected early, especially on susceptible hybrids, a fungicide spray can be beneficial. Fungicides containing Propiconazole or a combination of Mancozeb are often used.

CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE: Consult local agricultural experts to determine if a fungicide spray is economically justified. Always follow label directions and safety precautions.

Prevention Plan:

Resistant Hybrids: This is the most effective and economical way to manage Gray Leaf Spot. When purchasing seeds, specifically ask for corn hybrids with a high resistance rating for Gray Leaf Spot, suitable for the agro-climatic zone of Uttarakhand.

Crop Rotation: The fungus survives on infected corn residue. Do not plant corn in the same field for at least two years. Rotate with non-grass crops like legumes (beans, lentils) or vegetables (potato, tomato) to break the disease cycle.

Residue Management: After harvest, chop the corn stalks and plow the residue deep into the soil. Burying the infected debris prevents the fungus from releasing spores onto the next season's crop. If tillage is not possible on terraces, remove and destroy as much of the old crop residue as you can.

Improve Air Circulation: Avoid planting the corn too densely. Following recommended row and plant spacing allows for better air movement, which helps leaves dry faster and reduces the chance of infection.
