Appearance of a Healthy Leaf:

Healthy tomato leaves are a vibrant, deep green and are typically slightly fuzzy to the touch.

The leaves are compound with multiple leaflets and should be open and angled towards the sun.

They should be free of spots, holes, yellowing, curling, or any signs of pests.

Key Practices for Maintaining Health:

Staking or Trellising: From an early stage, provide strong support for your tomato plants using stakes, cages, or a trellis system. This keeps the leaves and fruit off the ground, which dramatically improves air circulation and reduces the risk of soil-borne diseases and fruit rot.

Proper Pruning ("Suckering"): Regularly remove the small shoots ("suckers") that grow in the junction between the main stem and a branch. This channels the plant's energy into producing fruit rather than excessive foliage, and further improves airflow.

Consistent Watering: Water tomato plants deeply at the base, providing consistent moisture. Irregular watering (letting the soil get very dry and then very wet) is a primary cause of blossom-end rot and fruit cracking. Drip irrigation is ideal.

Mulching: Apply a layer of organic mulch (like straw or grass clippings) around the plants. This conserves water, suppresses weeds, and prevents soil-borne diseases from splashing onto the lower leaves.

Balanced Nutrition: Tomatoes are heavy feeders. Provide them with a balanced fertilizer that is rich in phosphorus and potassium to support flowering and fruiting. Avoid too much nitrogen, which can lead to lots of leaves but little fruit.
