Symptoms:

Look for dark brown to black spots on the lower, older leaves.

A key feature is that these spots have distinct concentric rings, like a "target board" or a bull's-eye. A yellow halo usually surrounds each spot.

As the disease spreads, the spots can merge, causing the entire leaf to turn yellow, wither, and fall off, starting from the bottom of the plant and moving upwards.

The disease can also cause dark, sunken lesions on the stems and at the stem end of the tomato fruit (blossom-end rot is different).

Treatment Guide:

Chemical Treatment: Protective fungicidal sprays can prevent the disease from spreading to new, healthy leaves. Fungicides containing Mancozeb, Chlorothalonil, or Copper Oxychloride are effective. It's best to start spraying when the first symptoms appear and repeat every 7-10 days if weather is warm and humid. Alternating fungicides is recommended to prevent resistance.

CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE: Always consult a local agricultural extension officer for the correct fungicide and spray schedule. Read and follow all safety instructions on the product label.

Organic and Cultural Management: Remove and destroy infected lower leaves as soon as you see them to reduce the spread. Sprays of copper-based organic fungicides or a Bordeaux mixture can be effective if used preventatively.

Prevention Plan:

Crop Rotation: This is crucial. Do not plant tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants (brinjal), or peppers in the same soil for at least two to three years. The fungus survives on infected plant debris in the soil.

Use Disease-Free Seed and Transplants: Always start with certified, disease-free seeds or healthy transplants from a reputable nursery.

Field Sanitation: After the final harvest, remove, burn, or deeply plow all old plant debris to reduce the amount of fungus that overwinters in your field.

Watering Technique: Water plants at the base (drip or furrow irrigation). Avoid overhead sprinklers. If you must water overhead, do it in the morning so the leaves dry quickly in the sun.

Mulching: Apply a layer of organic mulch (like straw or dried leaves) around the base of the plants. This creates a barrier that prevents fungal spores from splashing up from the soil onto the lower leaves during rain.
