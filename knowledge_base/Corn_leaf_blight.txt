Symptoms:

Look for large, elliptical, cigar-shaped lesions on the leaves.

These lesions are typically grayish-green to tan in color and can be from 2 to 15 cm long.

The disease usually starts on the lower leaves and moves up the plant.

During damp weather, the lesions can grow and merge, destroying large areas of leaf tissue. A severely infected field can look like it has been damaged by frost.

Treatment Guide:

Chemical Treatment: Fungicide application is generally only recommended for high-value crops or under very severe disease pressure. Products containing Mancozeb or Propiconazole can be effective.

CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE: Always consult a local agricultural extension officer. Follow the product label instructions carefully.

Prevention Plan:

Resistant Hybrids: The best method of control is planting resistant corn hybrids. Check with local seed suppliers for varieties with proven resistance to Northern Corn Leaf Blight in your region.

Crop Rotation and Tillage: The fungus overwinters on infected corn debris. Rotating to a different crop for a year and, where possible, plowing the residue under the soil are very effective at reducing the disease.

Water Management: Avoid overhead irrigation or sprinkler systems, especially in the evening. If used, water in the morning so the leaves have ample time to dry during the day. Drip irrigation is the best alternative.

Balanced Nutrition: Ensure the crop has a balanced supply of nutrients, especially potassium, as this helps the plant build stronger cell walls and resist fungal attack.
