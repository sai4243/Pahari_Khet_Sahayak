Symptoms:

This is a very fast-spreading and destructive disease, especially in the cool, moist conditions of hilly regions.

Symptoms often appear first on the edges or tips of the leaves as small, water-soaked, pale green or grayish spots.

These spots enlarge rapidly into large, dark brown or black lesions, often with a fuzzy, white or grayish mold on the underside of the leaf, especially in the morning or during humid weather.

The disease has a distinctive odor of decay. An entire field can be destroyed in just a few days under favorable conditions.

Infected tubers develop a reddish-brown, dry rot that spreads from the skin inwards.

Treatment Guide:

Chemical Treatment: Immediate action is critical. A combination of contact and systemic fungicides is the most effective approach. Preventative sprays should begin before the disease appears, especially when weather forecasts predict cool, wet conditions. Fungicides containing Mancozeb, Chlorothalonil, Propiconazole, or Metalaxyl are commonly used.

CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE: Late blight is an aggressive disease. It is essential to consult a local agricultural expert immediately for a spray program. Always follow the product label and safety precautions.

Prevention Plan:

Use Certified Disease-Free Seed Tubers: This is the number one defense. Never plant tubers from an unknown source or from a crop that had late blight.

Destroy Volunteer Plants and Culls: Remove and destroy any "volunteer" potato plants that grow from tubers left in the field from the previous season, as well as any discarded cull piles. These are major sources of early infection.

Hilling: Create high, wide hills of soil around the base of the plants. This provides a barrier that can prevent spores washed from the leaves from reaching and infecting the tubers in the ground.

Resistant Varieties: Plant potato varieties that have a high level of resistance to late blight. Consult local agricultural universities for varieties best suited for Uttarakhand.

Water Management: Use drip irrigation to keep foliage dry. Avoid overhead watering.

Timely Harvest: Harvest the potatoes during dry weather. Before harvesting, it's often recommended to destroy the potato vines (haulms) 2-3 weeks in advance to prevent spores from contaminating the tubers during digging.
