Appearance of a Healthy Leaf:

A healthy soybean leaf is a lush, dark green color during the vegetative stage.

The leaves are trifoliate, meaning they have three leaflets.

They should be free from spots, yellowing (chlorosis), insect damage (holes or chewing), or any signs of stunting or distortion.

Key Practices for Maintaining Health:

Timely Sowing: Plant soybean at the onset of the monsoon (Kharif season) as recommended for your specific region in Uttarakhand. Proper timing is crucial for good germination and plant establishment.

Seed Treatment: Use high-quality, certified seeds and treat them with a Rhizobium culture inoculant before sowing. This helps the plant fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, leading to healthier growth and better yields. Also, treat seeds with a fungicide to protect against seed-borne diseases.

Weed Management: Soybeans are very sensitive to weed competition, especially in the first 30-45 days. Keeping the field weed-free during this critical period is essential for a healthy crop.

Proper Spacing: Follow recommended plant spacing to ensure each plant has enough space, light, and air to grow properly, which also helps reduce the spread of diseases.

Integrated Pest and Disease Management: Regularly monitor the crop for common pests like girdle beetle and stem fly, and diseases like rust or yellow mosaic virus. Follow local expert recommendations for management.
