4. Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust)
SYMPTOMS:

Distinctive Stripes: The most identifiable feature is the appearance of small, bright yellow-to-orange colored pustules arranged in long, narrow stripes that run parallel to the leaf veins.

Pustule Arrangement: These stripes are clearly defined and give the leaf a striped appearance, hence the name "stripe rust."

Spore Release: The yellow spores are powdery and easily rub off onto fingers or clothing.

Progression: In severe cases, the stripes can merge, causing the entire leaf to turn yellow and die. Pustules can also appear on the inner side of glumes in the earhead.

Regional Prevalence: This disease is particularly severe in the cooler, hilly regions of northern India, including Uttarakhand, where conditions are highly favorable for its development.

TREATMENT:

Chemical Control:

Yellow rust can spread very rapidly under cool, moist conditions. A timely foliar spray of a systemic fungicide is highly effective.

Propiconazole is the most widely used and recommended fungicide for controlling yellow rust in the northern hill zone of India. Other effective options include Tebuconazole.

Close monitoring is essential. Spray immediately when the first signs of the disease are noticed in the crop.

PREVENTION:

Resistant Varieties: Planting certified, newer wheat varieties that are specifically resistant to the prevalent races of yellow rust is the best defense. Old, susceptible varieties (like PBW 343) should be completely avoided.

Timely Sowing: Sowing at the optimal time recommended for your specific region in Uttarakhand helps the plant to be well-established before conditions become ideal for rust development.

Balanced Fertilization: Avoid excessive nitrogen application. Ensure a balanced dose of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) to enhance the plant's natural defense mechanisms.

Destroy Volunteer Plants: Remove any self-sown wheat plants from the previous season, as well as weed hosts, as they can serve as an early source of infection (a "green bridge") for the new crop.
