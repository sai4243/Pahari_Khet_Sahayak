Symptoms:

Causes small, dark, water-soaked, circular spots on the leaves. These spots are often greasy in appearance.

Unlike fungal spots, bacterial spots do not have concentric rings. They may be surrounded by a yellow halo.

The centers of the spots may dry out and tear, but they typically don't fall out like in "shot-hole" diseases.

On green fruit, the spots are small, raised, and scabby.

Treatment Guide:

Chemical Treatment: Control is very difficult. Preventative sprays are the only effective chemical option. Sprays containing Copper Hydroxide combined with Mancozeb can help protect healthy plants.

CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE: Follow all label instructions. Do not apply copper sprays in very hot, sunny conditions.

Organic Management: Copper sprays are often the only option and are permitted in many organic systems.

Prevention Plan:

Use Certified Disease-Free Seed: The bacteria is often seed-borne. Always start with clean seeds from a reliable source.

Crop Rotation: Practice a 3-year rotation, avoiding peppers and tomatoes in the same soil.

Sanitation: Do not work in the field when plants are wet, as this easily spreads the bacteria. Remove and destroy infected plants and all crop residue after harvest.

Water Management: Use drip irrigation to keep leaves dry. The bacteria spreads rapidly through water splash.
