Symptoms:

On Leaves: The disease causes small, angular, water-soaked spots. These spots often turn purplish or black. The centers of these spots frequently dry and fall out, leaving a ragged "shot-hole" appearance on the leaf. Infected leaves may turn yellow and drop from the tree.

On Fruit: Spots on the fruit are typically small, circular, and sunken, and may have cracks.

Treatment Guide:

Chemical Treatment: Control is very difficult once the growing season begins. The most important sprays are preventative and applied when the tree is dormant. Sprays of copper-based bactericides (like Bordeaux mixture) are critical.

CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE: Follow the recommendations of local horticultural experts for timing and concentration. Improper use of copper sprays can damage the tree. Always adhere to the product label.

Prevention Plan:

Resistant Varieties: When planting a new orchard, choose peach and nectarine varieties that show good resistance to bacterial spot.

Dormant Season Sprays: This is the most crucial preventative step. Apply a thorough spray of a copper-based compound after the leaves have fallen in autumn and/or before the buds swell in early spring. This kills the bacteria overwintering on the bark.

Strategic Pruning: Prune trees annually during the dormant, dry winter season to promote good air circulation. This helps foliage dry quickly. If you see any cankers (dark, sunken areas) on twigs, prune them out well below the visible infection and burn the cuttings.

Site Selection: Plant peach trees in locations that receive full morning sun and have good air movement. This helps to dry dew from the leaves quickly, reducing the window for infection.

Nitrogen Management: Be cautious with nitrogen fertilizer, especially in the spring. Too much nitrogen promotes lush, soft new growth that is highly susceptible to bacterial infection.
