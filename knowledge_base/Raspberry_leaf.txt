Appearance of a Healthy Leaf:

Healthy raspberry leaves are typically a medium to dark green color on top and a silvery-white on the underside.

They are compound leaves, usually with 3 or 5 toothed leaflets.

The leaves should be free of yellowing, spots, rust-colored pustules, or powdery mildew. The canes (stems) should look vigorous and healthy.

Key Practices for Maintaining Health:

Pruning: This is essential for raspberries. After the harvest, prune out the old canes that have already produced fruit (these are called floricanes and will not fruit again). This opens up the plant to sunlight and air circulation, which is the best way to prevent fungal diseases.

Trellising and Support: Use a trellis or wire system to support the raspberry canes. This keeps them off the ground, improves airflow, makes harvesting easier, and reduces disease risk.

Soil and Water Management: Raspberries thrive in well-drained soil rich in organic matter. Mulch around the base of the plants with compost or straw to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and feed the soil. Water at the base of the plant to keep the leaves dry.

Weed Control: Keep the raspberry patch free of weeds, which compete for nutrients and can host pests and diseases.
