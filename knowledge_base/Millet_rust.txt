Finger Millet Rust (Millet Rust)

SYMPTOMS:
- Reddish-brown pustules appear on leaf blades and sheaths, starting as small yellowish spots and becoming powdery.
- Pustules occur on both upper and lower leaf surfaces, often beginning on older leaves.
- When rubbed, infected leaves release reddish-brown spore powder.
- Heavy infestation causes leaves to yellow, dry prematurely, and reduce yield.

TREATMENT:
- Chemical Control:
  * Spray Mancozeb (0.2%) or Propiconazole as soon as rust is observed.
  * Example: Dithane M-45 (Mancozeb) 0.2% spray at 10-day intervals, starting one month after sowing.
  * Always consult local extension officers for dosage and timing. Follow label instructions strictly.
- Organic/Biological Control:
  * Neem-based sprays (azadirachtin) or biocontrol fungi like Trichoderma can help suppress rust.
  * Dusting with finely ground sulfur is effective in early stages.
  * Remove infected leaves/plants to reduce spore spread.

PREVENTION:
- Use rust-resistant finger millet varieties whenever available.
- Sow early in the rainy season to avoid peak rust pressure.
- Remove alternate hosts (wild grasses) and volunteer plants from fields and bunds.
- Rotate finger millet with non-host crops such as legumes.
- Maintain balanced soil nutrition and avoid excess nitrogen, which promotes susceptibility.
