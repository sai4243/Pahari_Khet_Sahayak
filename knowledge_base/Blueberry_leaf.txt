Appearance of a Healthy Leaf:

A healthy blueberry leaf is typically dark green, oval-shaped, and has a slightly waxy or leathery texture.

The edges are smooth or very finely serrated.

There should be no spots, discoloration, or powdery growth on the leaf surface.

Key Practices for Maintaining Health:

Acidic Soil: This is the most critical requirement for blueberries. They need acidic soil with a pH between 4.5 and 5.5. In the soils of Uttarakhand, it is essential to amend the soil with materials like pine needle mulch or sulfur to lower the pH.

Mulching: Apply a thick layer of organic mulch (like pine needles or wood chips) around the base of the plants. This helps retain soil moisture, suppress weeds, and maintain the acidic soil conditions that blueberries love.

Watering: Blueberries have shallow roots and require consistent moisture, especially during dry periods. Water them regularly, ensuring the soil stays moist but not waterlogged.

Sunlight: Plant blueberries in a location that receives full sun for most of the day.
