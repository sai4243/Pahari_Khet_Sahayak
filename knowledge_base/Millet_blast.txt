Finger Millet Blast (Leaf, Neck, and Finger Blast)

SYMPTOMS:
- Leaf Lesions: Small, spindle-shaped spots with grayish-white centers and dark-brown margins. Spots may coalesce, causing a scorched leaf appearance.
- Neck Blast: The portion just below the earhead turns brown/black, shrivels, and earheads droop. Nutrient flow to grains stops, leading to empty or shriveled grains.
- Node Blast: Nodes and culms turn black and may break easily.
- Finger Blast: Lesions appear on panicle fingers, usually from the tip downward, causing spikelets to shrivel and grain loss.
- Severe infections can kill seedlings or give plants a blighted appearance.

TREATMENT:
- Chemical Control:
  * Apply systemic fungicides like Carbendazim (0.1%) or Tricyclazole (0.05–0.1%) at first symptoms.
  * Two sprays are recommended: one at tillering and another at panicle emergence or flowering.
  * Example: Two sprays of Tricyclazole 0.2% at 10-day interval from 50% flowering.
- Seed Treatment:
  * Treat seed with Carbendazim (2 g/kg) before sowing to reduce seed-borne inoculum.
- Biological Control:
  * Seed treatment with Trichoderma harzianum or Pseudomonas fluorescens (6 g/kg seed).
  * Foliar sprays of Pseudomonas fluorescens (0.3%) at flowering and 10 days later help reduce infection.
- Cultural Control:
  * Remove and burn heavily infected plants.
  * Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization.
  * Adequate soil silica improves plant resistance.

PREVENTION:
- Plant blast-resistant varieties (e.g., GPU 28, GPU 45, VL 149).
- Use certified seed and treat with fungicide before sowing.
- Sow at the recommended Kharif season time to avoid peak humidity and blast periods.
- Apply balanced fertilizers (avoid excess nitrogen, ensure adequate potassium and silica).
- Remove and destroy stubble and debris after harvest; plough residues into the soil.
- Weed out grasses and alternate hosts around fields and bunds.
