3. Stem Rust (Black Rust)
SYMPTOMS:

Pustules: Produces large, oval-shaped, brick-red to reddish-brown pustules on stems, leaves, and leaf sheaths.

Stem Rupture: A key characteristic is that the pustules on the stem are large and ragged, causing the plant's outer layer (epidermis) to rupture and fray. This gives the stem a rough, torn appearance.

Spore Release: The pustules release a large amount of reddish-brown powdery spores (urediniospores) that can easily be seen on fingers or clothing.

Late Season: As the plant matures, the pustules turn dark and blackish (teliospores), giving the disease its common name, "black rust."

Overall Impact: Infected plants become weak, are prone to lodging (falling over), and produce severely shriveled, lightweight grains, leading to catastrophic yield loss.

TREATMENT:

Chemical Control:

This disease develops and spreads extremely rapidly. Timely application of fungicides like Tebuconazole or Propiconazole is crucial.

Spraying must be done at the very first sign of rust in the field or region. Once established, it is very difficult to control. Early warning systems and community-level monitoring are vital.

PREVENTION:

Resistant Varieties: This is the single most important and effective control measure. National breeding programs continuously develop new wheat varieties with resistance to prevailing rust races. Always use certified, recommended resistant seeds.

Field Sanitation: Remove and destroy "volunteer" (self-sown) wheat plants and alternate host plants. The common barberry bush (Berberis vulgaris) is a major alternate host that allows the rust fungus to complete its life cycle and create new races.

Avoid Late Sowing: Planting at the recommended time helps the crop mature before temperatures become highly favorable for a rust epidemic (warm and humid conditions).

Nutrient Management: Maintain a balanced fertilizer regime, avoiding excessive nitrogen.
