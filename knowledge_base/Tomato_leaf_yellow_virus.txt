Symptoms:

THERE IS NO CURE FOR THIS VIRUS.

The most characteristic symptom is the upward curling, yellowing, and cupping of the leaves.

New leaves are often much smaller than normal.

The entire plant is severely stunted, taking on a bushy appearance because the distance between leaves on the stem is shortened.

The plant may produce very few or no flowers and fruits. If fruit does form, it is small and of poor quality.

Treatment Guide:

No Treatment Exists: There are no chemical or organic sprays to cure a plant infected with TYLCV.

Remove and Destroy: Infected plants must be removed and destroyed immediately to prevent the disease from spreading to healthy plants.

Prevention Plan:

Vector Control: This is the absolute key to prevention. The virus is spread by the silverleaf whitefly. Controlling the whitefly population is the only way to manage this disease.

Insecticides: Use systemic insecticides like Imidacloprid on seedlings before transplanting or as a soil drench. Foliar sprays can also be used, but it's important to rotate chemical types to prevent resistance.

Yellow Sticky Traps: Place yellow sticky traps throughout the field to monitor and trap adult whiteflies.

Reflective Mulches: Using silver-colored plastic mulches can help repel whiteflies.

Use Resistant Varieties: Plant tomato hybrids that are specifically bred for resistance to TYLCV. This is the most effective long-term strategy.

Weed Management: Remove weeds in and around the field, as they can serve as hosts for the whiteflies.

Netting: In small-scale or nursery settings, protecting seedlings with insect-proof netting can prevent whiteflies from reaching them.
