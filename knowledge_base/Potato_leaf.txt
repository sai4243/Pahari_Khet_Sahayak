Appearance of a Healthy Leaf:

A healthy potato leaf is typically a vibrant, uniform shade of green.

The leaves are compound, with several leaflets, and should be full and turgid (not wilting).

The surface should be free of any spots, lesions, yellowing, or signs of insect damage.

Key Practices for Maintaining Health:

Quality Seed Tubers: The health of the entire crop starts with high-quality, certified disease-free seed potatoes. This is the best investment a farmer can make.

Proper Hilling: As the potato plants grow, regularly mound soil up around the base of the stems. This practice, known as hilling, protects the developing tubers from sunlight (which turns them green and bitter) and from pests and late blight spores.

Consistent Watering: Potatoes require consistent moisture, especially during the tuber formation stage. Water deeply at the soil level to encourage deep root growth. Irregular watering can lead to misshapen or hollow tubers.

Balanced Nutrition: Provide a balanced fertilizer based on a soil test. Potatoes are heavy feeders of potassium (K), which is essential for tuber size and quality.

Integrated Pest Management (IPM): Regularly inspect plants for common pests like aphids, leafhoppers, and tuber moths. Pests not only cause direct damage but can also transmit viruses that weaken the plant.
