Symptoms:

On Leaves: The disease first appears as small, circular, yellowish spots on the leaves. As these spots grow, they develop a dark brown to black border, with the center turning a lighter reddish-brown. You may see tiny black dots (pycnidia) within the lesions.

On Shoots and Stems: Lesions can also appear on young shoots, which can cause them to wilt.

On Fruit (Most Destructive): The infection on the grapes is the most damaging. It starts as a small, whitish spot that quickly enlarges. Within a few days, the entire berry rots, turns black, and shrivels into a hard, wrinkled "mummy."

Treatment Guide:

Chemical Treatment: A strict, preventative fungicide spray program is essential for controlling black rot in regions where it is common. Sprays should begin as new shoots are 1-2 inches long and continue at regular 7-14 day intervals until the grapes begin to change color. Fungicides containing Mancozeb or Captan are very effective.

CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE: Consult local horticultural experts for a spray schedule tailored to Uttarakhand's climate. Follow all label instructions.

Prevention Plan:

Sanitation (Most Important): The black rot fungus overwinters in the shriveled "mummies" left on the vine or on the ground. During winter pruning, it is absolutely critical to remove and destroy every single mummy you can find. This is the primary source of infection for the next year. Also, remove any infected canes.

Improve Air Circulation: Use a proper trellis system (like the Kniffin system) to support the vines. Prune the vines annually and perform shoot thinning and leaf removal during the growing season to open up the canopy. This allows leaves and fruit clusters to dry quickly.

Site Selection: Plant grapes in a location with full sun exposure and good air movement. Avoid low-lying areas where fog and dew linger.

Weed Control: Keep the ground under the vines clean to reduce humidity and improve airflow.
