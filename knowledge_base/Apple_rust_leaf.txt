Symptoms:

In the spring, small, pale yellow spots appear on the upper surface of the apple leaves.

These spots gradually enlarge and turn a bright orange or reddish color, sometimes with a red border.

Tiny black dots may appear in the center of these orange spots.

Later in the season, tube-like structures may form on the underside of the leaf, directly below the spots.

Severely infected leaves may turn yellow and drop early.

Treatment Guide:

Chemical Treatment: Fungicide sprays are effective if applied preventatively. Sprays should start after the petals fall and continue for several weeks. Fungicides containing Myclobutanil or Mancozeb are effective against rusts.

CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE: The timing of sprays is very important. Always consult a local agricultural expert for the correct schedule for your region. Follow all safety instructions on the product label.

Prevention Plan:

Remove Alternate Host: Cedar Apple Rust requires two host plants to complete its life cycle: an apple tree and a juniper or cedar tree (often found in the hills of Uttarakhand). If possible, remove any juniper or cedar trees within a few hundred meters of your apple orchard to break the disease cycle.

Resistant Varieties: Plant apple varieties that are resistant to Cedar Apple Rust.

Fungicide Sprays: If juniper hosts cannot be removed, a preventative fungicide spray program during the spring is the most reliable control method.
