Appearance of a Healthy Leaf:

A healthy grape leaf is typically large, with 3 to 5 distinct lobes, resembling a large maple leaf.

The color should be a consistent, healthy green, and the leaf should be fully expanded.

The surface should be free of spots, powdery mildew, insect damage, or discoloration.

Key Practices for Maintaining Health:

Proper Pruning: Grapes must be pruned heavily every year during the dormant winter season. Pruning controls the size of the vine, removes old wood, and determines the amount of fruit the vine will produce. This is the most important practice for maintaining vine health and productivity.

Trellising: Provide a strong trellis system to support the vines. This keeps the vine off the ground, organizes the growth, and dramatically improves sunlight exposure and air circulation, which is essential for preventing fungal diseases.

Canopy Management: During the growing season, practices like shoot thinning (removing excess shoots) and leaf pulling (removing a few leaves around the fruit clusters) can further improve air and sun exposure, leading to better quality fruit and less disease.

Watering: Water the vines deeply and infrequently at the base. Grapes are relatively drought-tolerant once established, but consistent water is needed for good fruit development. Avoid wetting the leaves.

Balanced Nutrition: Apply fertilizer or compost based on soil tests. Be careful not to apply too much nitrogen, which can cause excessive vine growth at the expense of fruit production.
