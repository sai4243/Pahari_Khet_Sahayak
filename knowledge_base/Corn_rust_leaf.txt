Symptoms:

Small, circular to elongated, cinnamon-brown colored pustules appear on both the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves.

These pustules are powdery and will leave a rusty-colored dust (fungal spores) on your fingers if you rub them.

Pustules are often scattered across the leaf and can be quite dense in a heavy infection.

While very common, this disease is usually not as damaging as leaf blights unless the infection occurs early and is very severe.

Treatment Guide:

Chemical Treatment: Fungicides are rarely necessary for controlling Common Rust, as most modern hybrids have good resistance. If needed for a particularly susceptible variety, products used for leaf blights are also effective against rust.

CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE: Consult a local agricultural expert before deciding to spray.

Prevention Plan:

Resistant Hybrids: The vast majority of modern corn hybrids planted in India have excellent genetic resistance to Common Rust. This is the primary and most effective control method.

Timely Planting: Planting early within the recommended sowing window for your region can help the crop pass its most susceptible stages before the rust becomes widespread.

Weed Management: Control alternate host plants, such as certain species of Oxalis (wood sorrel), in and around the field, as they can be a source for the rust fungus.

Avoid Excessive Nitrogen: Over-application of nitrogen fertilizer can make plants more susceptible. Use a balanced fertility program based on soil needs.
